# Run Configuration

Operational settings for the BET 2026 single-area model runner.

## Current Defaults

<!-- This section is generated from job-config.R. It is refreshed by Makefile targets and the local pre-commit hook once a Makefile target has run. -->

| `setting` | `value` | `meaning` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default_step_select` | `all` | Model selection used when `STEP_SELECT` is not supplied. |
| `flow_group` | `bet-2026-single-area` | Kflow group label used to connect model, results, and report jobs. |
| `trigger_next` | `true` | Whether command-line Kflow submissions keep the downstream results/report chain. |
| `docker_image` | `ghcr.io/pacificcommunity/tuna-flow:v2.2` | Docker image used by Kflow and local Docker runs. |
| `program_path` | `/home/mfcl/mfclo64` | MFCL executable path inside the Docker image. |
| `stepwise_save_final_par` | `false` | Optional: copy the final `.par` back into `steps/<step_id>/model/`. Off by default; Kflow outputs always include `outputs/models/<step_id>/final.par`. |
| `stepwise_save_raw_mfcl_inputs` | `true` | Preserve the full raw MFCL input folder under `outputs/models/<step_id>/mfcl-inputs/` for native-style auditability. |
| `stepwise_commit_final_pars` | `false` | Optional: create a narrow KflowBot commit containing saved final `.par` files. Off by default to avoid concurrent job push conflicts. |
| `stepwise_push_final_pars` | `false` | Optional: push the saved final `.par` commit to the current branch. Off by default. |
| `par_source_job` | `blank` | Optional previous Kflow job number/reference used with `RUN_MODE=job_par`. |
| `stepwise_par_source_dir` | `blank` | Optional local folder to search for previous output `.par` files when testing `RUN_MODE=job_par` outside Kflow. |
| `kflow_input_jobs` | `blank` | Optional Kflow input job number(s) to attach. For `.par` reruns, set this to the same previous same-step job as `PAR_SOURCE_JOB`. |
